# Words Per Minute

This is a simple game for measuring your typing speed or learning a new
keyboard layout.  It is designed to teach the Dvorak keyboard layout.  However,
this is only one of many possible use cases.

The game begins with the selection of a pre-determined paragraph of text.  This
triggers a countdown, after which the paragraph is revealed.  Once typing
begins, the game displays the duration of your session and a calculated word
per minute (WPM) value.  Additionally, it allows you to change your keyboard
mapping to try out the Dvorak layout on-the-fly.

The game is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external dependencies.
Additionally, the paragraphs of text can be completely customized, depending on
your typing goals.
