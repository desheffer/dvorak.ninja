# Words Per Minute

This is a simple game for measuring your typing speed or learning a new
keyboard layout.  It is designed to teach the Dvorak keyboard layout, although
that is just one of many possible use cases.

The game allows you to select from a list of pre-defined word sets.  As you
type, the game will show your calculated words per minute (WPM) score in real
time, as well as other statistics.

If you choose, you can enable on-the-fly Dvorak mapping.  This allows you to
experiment with an alternate keyboard layout without changing any settings on
your computer.
