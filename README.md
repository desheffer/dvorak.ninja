# Words Per Minute

This is a simple game for measuring your typing speed or learning a new
keyboard layout.  It is designed to teach the Dvorak keyboard layout, although
that is just one of many possible use cases.

The game allows you to select from a list of pre-defined word sets.  After a
countdown, begin typing the words shown.  The game will show your calculated
words per minute (WPM) score in real time.  If you choose, you can enable
on-the-fly Dvorak mapping if you wish to experiment with a new keyboard layout.

The game is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The available word sets can
be customized based on your typing goals.
