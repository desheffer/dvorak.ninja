# Words Per Minute

This is a simple game for measuring your typing speed or learning a new
keyboard layout.  It is designed to teach the Dvorak keyboard layout, although
that is just one of many possible use cases.

The game allows you to select from a list of pre-defined paragraphs of text.
After a countdown, typing begins and you are shown your calculated words per
minute (WPM) score in real time.  The game also provides on-the-fly Dvorak
mapping if you wish to experiment with a new keyboard layout.

The game is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external dependencies.
Additionally, the paragraphs of text can be customized based on your typing
goals.
